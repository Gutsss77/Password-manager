# Password-manager
I am Ansh Sharma, I have created this project based on python tkinter library and having a database connectivity also using MySQL database.
I have provided the code in the file(passmanager.py). Basically this project is based on storing the password of user which he uses in different websites. For example : Let a user 'A' , he/she have accounts on 3 websites instagram, gmail, facebook so rather than saving his password any other place he can use this application to store his/her password. In this application the user register for an account where he create a username and password after that he uses that username and password to store his passwords into it.

Prerequisites the user should know about python and  have installed python and have tkinter library of python as well as he should have another library for database connectivity 'mysql.connector' in his system to execute this code successfully also I'm Providing the Mysql(query code) code so that a user can easily run this code with database connectivity.

The SQL code should be written in Mysql workbench or any other IDE but it should support MySQL as for this code provided.

To help me make this code better ,contact me through mail (lxngvx7@gmail.com)

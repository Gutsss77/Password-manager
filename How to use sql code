To use the MySQL command here is the description for this:
Firstly, you should have installed MySQL installed. To use it you can use MySQL workbench you can on internet how to install it.
Now for the code provided in .sql file you don't have to run all at same time.
Now follow the steps:

CREATE DATABASE password_users;
USE password_users;

#run this,

CREATE TABLE log_users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    contact_no VARCHAR(15),
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);



CREATE TABLE web_passwords (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT,
website VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
username VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES log_users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

#create table for the user to store his username and password , also create table where user will store his password of different website.

CREATE USER 'Gutsss'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'gutsss77';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON password_users.* TO 'Gutsss'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

#It's better to create new user to use the sql database. Here, 'Gutsss' is the user for Mysql database and password is 'gutsss77'.
You can change according to yourself about also change it in the python code as well where the connection is stablished.

Now all ready you can use it, but its better you to know mysql before implementing this code on your system :)
